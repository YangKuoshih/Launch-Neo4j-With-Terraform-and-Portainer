# my-neo4j: Workbench
Neo4j Enterprise Platform on AWS. Deploy a Neo4j Enterprise for individual use and rapid experimentation. Includes Neo4j Enterprise Evaluation version and essential tools like Portainer for managing the docker container images. Perfect for Graph Database enthusiasts seeking a quick, secure personal sandbox.

## Assumptions and pre-requisites
- You are using Windows machine
- You have access to an AWS account
- You are using us-east-1 region

## Design principles
- Keep cost lowest
- KISS - Keep it simple, stupid 
- Scalability and performance are not primary focus. Primary focus is to get things done quickly.
- Security is tight. But only as much required. (Ex: using dummy certs to enable HTTPS)

## What will be installed?
- An EC2 will be created and following softwares will be installed in it:
    - Neo4j Enterprise Edition with Evaluation License (30-Day Trial)
    - Portainer (Web based Docker management)
    - Caddy (reverse proxy and authetication server for Portainer)

## Why should I use this?
- Terraform is leveraged for east deployment of a Neo4j Enterprise instance.
- You have your own instance of Neo4j for your usage. 
- Best use of your AWS account to learn and experiment with a popular Graph DB.

## SETUP GUIDE
### Step 1 Clone this project
- Open cmd window and execute:
```bat
git clone https://github.com/YangKuoshih/Launch-Neo4j-With-Terraform-and-Portainer.git
cd Launch-Neo4j-With-Terraform-and-Portainer
```
### Step 2 Install Terraform
- After cloning the project files from Github go to where you cloned the project folder.
- Run cd scripts
- In cmd run install-terraform.bat 

### Step 3 Install Git for Windows
- Download and install from:  
https://git-scm.com/downloads/win

### Step 4 Install AWS CLI for Windows. Follow:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html

### Step 5 Login to AWS
- Either set the AWS credentials env vars
- OR, setup profile and set AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE
- Ensure env var AWS_REGION is set
- Note that your credentials and config files are in .aws folder in your HOME folder.
    - If you do not have this folder or files, you should do ``aws configure``, or create them manually.
#### How to get credentials:
- If you are using AWS Access Portal, after login, you will see screen like (Click on your name):  
<img src="docs/images/aws-login.PNG" width="100%" alt="Screen after AWS login">
- Click on "Acces keys", then go to Windows tab:  

<img src="docs/images/aws-login-creds-windows-tab.PNG" width="100%" alt="AWS keys windows tab">

- Go to Options 1 and copy credentials by clicking the blue icon on the right: 

<img src="docs/images/aws-login-creds-option1.PNG" width="100%" alt="AWS keys windows tab">

- Go back to the cmd window and paste it and hit Enter.
- Better way to login is to use AWS Profile. See guide here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/v1/userguide/cli-configure-files.html

### Step 6 Go to your terraform folder in the project file and initialize and apply terraform
```bat
cd terraform  
terraform init  
terraform apply  
```
- Check the plan and when ask for Enter a value, enter yes, hit Enter key
- This may take a few min when you run first time

### Step 7 If you like to use the command line to launch the application
- Open cmd window, if not already open.
- Make sure you do one of the following:
    - Set AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE
    - Set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY and AWS_SESSION_TOKEN environment variable. 
- Cd to the project folder (cd Launch-Neo4j-With-Terraform-and-Portainer)
- Run following command
```bat
scripts\create-launcher.bat
```
- "launcher.bat" file is created in local folder.
- Windows Explorer is opened.
- Double click "launcher.bat" file.
- NOTE: If you use AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE you have create launcher only once. If you use AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID etc. env vars, you have to create launcher everytime you login.

### Step 8 User Launcher to Open Neo4j
- You will be admin for this instance.
- First time you use username 'neo4j' 
- password 'admin'

## Q&A
1. Q: What is Neo4j?
A: Neo4j is a high-performance, graph-based NoSQL database that uses a property graph model to store data. It excels in handling complex relationships and is ideal for applications that require flexible, interconnected data structures.

2. Q: How does Neo4j store data?
A: Neo4j stores data as nodes, relationships, and properties. Nodes represent entities, relationships connect these nodes, and properties provide additional information about both nodes and relationships.

3. Q: What is the Bolt protocol?
A: Bolt is Neo4jâ€™s native binary protocol designed for efficient, low-latency communication between Neo4j and its clients. It supports both secure and non-secure connections.

4. Q: How do I connect to Neo4j using Bolt?
A: You connect using a URL in the format bolt://<host>:7687 for an unsecured connection, or bolt+s://<host>:7687 if TLS is enabled for secure communication.

5. Q: How can I secure connections to Neo4j?
A: You can secure Neo4j by enabling TLS for both the HTTP (7474) and Bolt (7687) connectors. This can be done by setting the appropriate configuration (e.g., dbms.connector.bolt.tls_level=REQUIRED) or via environment variables in your Docker Compose file.

6. Q: How does Neo4j handle transactions?
A: Neo4j supports full ACID-compliant transactions, ensuring data consistency and reliability even in complex graph operations.

7. Q: What are some best practices for query performance in Neo4j?
A: Use indexes and constraints to speed up queries, profile and optimize your Cypher queries, and design your data model to efficiently capture your domain relationships.

8. Q: How do I monitor and troubleshoot Neo4j?
A: Monitor Neo4j using its built-in logging and metrics, and use tools like the Neo4j Browser or third-party monitoring solutions to analyze query performance and system health.

9. Q: What are the available drivers for Neo4j?
A: Neo4j provides official drivers for several languages including Java, Python, JavaScript, .NET, and more, allowing you to integrate it seamlessly with your application stack.

10. Q: How do I scale Neo4j Enterprise?
A: Neo4j Enterprise supports clustering for high availability and horizontal scaling, along with advanced security and monitoring features that help manage larger, more complex deployments.

11. Q: How can I perform backups in Neo4j?
A: You can use Neo4jâ€™s built-in backup utilities for both online and offline backups, and consider setting up automated backup scripts to ensure your data is safely stored.

12. Q: How do I integrate Neo4j into my application?
A: You can integrate Neo4j by using its REST API or one of its native Bolt drivers. The choice of driver depends on your applicationâ€™s programming language and architecture, making it flexible for a variety of use cases.
