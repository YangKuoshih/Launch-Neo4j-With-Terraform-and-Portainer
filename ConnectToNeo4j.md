# Connecting to Neo4j via Python
=====================================

## Prerequisites
---------------

* Python 3.6 or later
* Neo4j 3.5 or later
* `neo4j` Python driver (install with `pip install neo4j`)

## Step 1: Install the Neo4j Python Driver
------------------------------------------

```bash
pip install neo4j
Step 2: Import the Neo4j Driver
python
from neo4j import GraphDatabase
Step 3: Connect to Neo4j
python
# Replace with your Neo4j instance URL, username, and password
uri = "bolt://localhost:7687"
username = "neo4j"
password = "password"

# Create a driver instance
driver = GraphDatabase.driver(uri, auth=(username, password))
Step 4: Create a Session
python
# Create a session to interact with the graph
session = driver.session()
Step 5: Run a Cypher Query
python
# Run a Cypher query to retrieve data from the graph
result = session.run("MATCH (n) RETURN n")

# Print the results
for record in result:
    print(record["n"].properties)
Step 6: Close the Session and Driver
python
# Close the session and driver when finished
session.close()
driver.close()
Example Use Case
Here is an example of how to use the Neo4j Python driver to create a node and retrieve its properties:

python
from neo4j import GraphDatabase

# Connect to Neo4j
driver = GraphDatabase.driver("bolt://localhost:7687", auth=("neo4j", "password"))
session = driver.session()

# Create a node
session.run("CREATE (n:Person {name: 'Alice', age: 30})")

# Retrieve the node's properties
result = session.run("MATCH (n:Person {name: 'Alice'}) RETURN n")
for record in result:
    print(record["n"].properties)

# Close the session and driver
session.close()
driver.close()
Note: Make sure to replace the uri, username, and password placeholders with your actual Neo4j instance URL, username, and password.

You can save this as a file named Connecting_to_Neo4j_via_Python.md and upload it to your GitLab repository.

You can also use this command to save the file:
echo "# Connecting to Neo4j via Python..." > Connecting_to_Neo4j_via_Python.md

Then, copy and paste the rest of the content into the file.
